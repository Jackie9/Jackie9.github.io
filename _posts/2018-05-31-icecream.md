Afternoon tea is a tradition of this company. 

Our new foreign colleague, a beautiful girl, asked, can we have ice cream every week? Or you can set up a vending machine?

Then others replied in this way:

S : five sheeps

L : cute much

D : cover cow

C : dream dragon

Y : ice factory

J : Hagendaz

That's very funny.
